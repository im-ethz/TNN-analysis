               optimal physical and psychological development. For individuals
               with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), physical activity offers many health
               benefits including improved glycemic control, cardiovascular
               function, blood lipid profiles, and psychological well-being.
               Despite these benefits, many young people with T1D do not meet
               physical activity recommendations. Barriers to engaging in a
               physically active lifestyle include fear of hypoglycemia, as
               well as insufficient knowledge in managing diabetes around
               exercise in both individuals and health care professionals.
               Diabetes and exercise management is complex, and many factors
               can influence an individual's glycemic response to exercise
               including exercise related factors (such as type, intensity and
               duration of the activity) and person specific factors (amount of
               insulin on board, person's stress/anxiety and fitness levels).
               International guidelines provide recommendations for clinical
               practice, however a gap remains in how to apply these guidelines
               to a pediatric exercise consultation. Consequently, it can be
               challenging for health care practitioners to advise young people
               with T1D how to approach exercise management in a busy clinic
               setting. This review provides a structured approach to the
               child/adolescent exercise consultation, based on a framework of
               questions, to assist the health care professional in formulating
               person-specific exercise management plans for young people with

               of them do not undertake the recommended levels of activity.
               Whilst questionnaire-based studies have examined barriers to
               exercise in people with T1DM, a formal qualitative analysis of
               these barriers has not been undertaken. Our aims were to explore
               attitudes, barriers and facilitators to exercise in patients
               with T1DM. METHODOLOGY: A purposeful sample of long standing
               T1DM patients were invited to participate in this qualitative
               study. Twenty-six adults were interviewed using a
               semi-structured interview schedule to determine their level of
               exercise and barriers to initiation and maintenance of an
               exercise programme. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Six main barriers to
               exercise were identified: lack of time and work related factors;
               access to facilities; lack of motivation; embarrassment and body
               image; weather; and diabetes specific barriers (low levels of
               knowledge about managing diabetes and its complications around
               exercise). Four motivators to exercise were identified: physical
               benefits from exercise; improvements in body image; enjoyment
               and the social interaction of exercising at gym or in groups.
               Three facilitators to exercise were identified: free or reduced
               admission to gyms and pools, help with time management, and
               advice and encouragement around managing diabetes for exercise.
               SIGNIFICANCE: Many of the barriers to exercise in people with
               T1DM are shared with the non-diabetic population. The primary
               difference is the requirement for education about the effect of
               exercise on diabetes control and its complications. There was a
               preference for support to be given on a one to one basis rather
               than in a group environment. This suggests that with the
               addition of the above educational requirements, one to one
               techniques that have been successful in increasing activity in
               patients with other chronic disease and the general public
               should be successful in increasing activity in patients with
               T1DM.",

               Activity in Diabetes [type 1] [BAPAD1] scale) and factors
               associated with these barriers. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: One
               hundred adults with type 1 diabetes answered a questionnaire
               assessing perceived barriers to physical activity and related
               factors. A1C was obtained from the medical chart of each

               being the strongest barrier to physical activity. Greater
               knowledge about insulin pharmacokinetics and using appropriate
               approaches to minimize exercise-induced hypoglycemia were

              the sum of the climbs and descents was 3235 and 3055 m,

              glucometer, plasma lactate levels, and ketones in the capillary

              physical exertion by a person with type 1 diabetes is possible.
              All subjects avoided severe hypoglycemia by significantly

              reduced as the event progressed. Glycemic variability and time
              spent in hypoglycemia did not change throughout the ride for
              either set of riders. Riders with diabetes in the lowest quartile
              of sensor glucose values had significantly reduced power output.
              Percentage body fat also significantly fell. Hypo- and
              hyperglycemia provoked feelings of anxiety and worry.
              CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to describe a real-time
              endurance event in type 1 diabetes, and provides important new
              data that cannot be studied in laboratory conditions.
              Hypoglycemia continues to occurs in spite of peer support and
              large reductions in insulin dose. Glycemic variability is shown
              as a potential barrier to participation in physical activity

               over a 5-day Union Cycliste Internationale road-cycle race.
               MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective observational study,
               seven professional cyclists with T1D (age 28 $\pm$ 4 years, body
               mass index 20.9 $\pm$ 0.9 kg/m2 , glycated haemoglobin
               concentration 56 $\pm$ 7 mmol/mol [7.3\% $\pm$ 0.6\%]) were
               monitored during a five-stage professional road cycling race.
               Real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) data, smart
               insulin pen dose data and macronutrient intake were assessed by
               means of repeated-measure one-way ANOVA and post hoc testing.
               Associations between exercise physiological markers and rtCGM
               data, insulin doses and macronutrient intake were assessed via
               linear regression modelling (P $\leq$ 0.05). RESULTS: Bolus
               insulin dose was significantly reduced over the 5-day period (P
               = 0.03), while carbohydrate intake (P = 0.24) and basal insulin
               doses remained unchanged (P = 0.64). A higher mean previous-day
               race intensity was associated with a lower mean sensor glucose
               level (P = 0.03), less time above range level 2 (>13.9 mmol/L
               [250 mg/dL]; P = 0.05) and lower doses of bolus insulin (P =
               0.04) on the subsequent day. No significant associations were
               found for any other glycaemic range and glycaemic variability (P
               > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate the
               influence of previous-day race intensity on subsequent bolus
               insulin dose requirements in professional cyclists with T1D.

               early as a decrease in heart rate variability (HRV). In
               populations without diabetes, the positive effects of exercise
               training on HRV are well-documented. However, exercise in
               individuals with type 1 diabetes, particularly if strenuous and
               prolonged, can lead to sharp glycemic variations, which can
               negatively impact HRV. This study explores the impact of a 9-day
               cycling tour on HRV in this population, with a focus on
               exercise-induced glycemic excursions. RESEARCH DESIGN AND
               METHODS: Twenty amateur athletes with uncomplicated type 1
               diabetes cycled 1,500 km. HRV and glycemic variability were
               measured by heart rate and continuous glucose monitoring. Linear
               mixed models were used to test the effects of exercise on HRV,
               with concomitant glycemic excursions and subject characteristics
               considered as covariates. RESULTS: Nighttime HRV tended to
               decrease with the daily distance traveled. The more time the
               subjects spent in hyperglycemia, the lower the parasympathetic
               tone was. This result is striking given that hyperglycemic
               excursions progressively increased throughout the 9 days of the
               tour, and to a greater degree on the days a longer distance was
               traveled, while time spent in hypoglycemia surprisingly
               decreased. This phenomenon occurred despite no changes in
               insulin administration and a decrease in carbohydrate intake
               from snacks. CONCLUSIONS: In sports enthusiasts with type 1
               diabetes, multiday prolonged exercise at moderate-to-vigorous
               intensity worsened hyperglycemia, with hyperglycemia negatively
               associated with parasympathetic cardiac tone. Considering the
               putative deleterious consequences on cardiac risks, future work
               should focus on understanding and managing exercise-induced

               RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixteen male professional cyclists
               with T1D on multiple daily injections (age: 27$\pm$4 years;
               duration of T1D: 11$\pm$5 years; body mass index: 22$\pm$2
               kg/m2; glycated hemoglobin: 7\%$\pm$1\% (50$\pm$6 mmol/mol);
               maximum rate of oxygen consumption: 73$\pm$4 mL/kg/min)
               performed road cycle sessions (50\%-90\% of the anaerobic
               threshold, duration 1-6 hours) over 9 consecutive days. Glycemic
               (Dexcom G6), nutrition and physiological data were collected
               throughout. Glycemic data were stratified into predefined
               glycemic ranges and mapped alongside exercise physiology and
               nutritional parameters, as well as split into daytime and
               night-time phases for comparative analysis. Data were assessed
               by means of analysis of variance and paired t-tests. A p value
               of $\leq$0.05 (two-tailed) was statistically significant.
               RESULTS: Higher levels of antecedent hypoglycemia in the
               nocturnal hours were associated with greater time spent in
               next-day hypoglycemia overall (p=0.003) and during exercise
               (p=0.019). Occurrence of nocturnal hypoglycemia was associated
               with over three times the risk of next-day hypoglycemia
               (p<0.001) and a twofold risk of low glucose during cycling
               (p<0.001). Moreover, there was trend for a greater amount of
               time spent in mild hypoglycemia during the night compared with
               daytime hours (p=0.080). CONCLUSION: The higher prevalence of
               nocturnal hypoglycemia was associated with an increased risk of
               next-day hypoglycemia, which extended to cycle training
               sessions. These data highlight the potential need for additional
               prebed carbohydrates and/or insulin dose reduction strategies

               and hyperglycemia. Purpose: To evaluate the impact of two
               consecutive days of carbohydrate (CHO) loading, followed by high
               intermittent CHO-intake during prolonged PE, facilitated by a
               proactive use of Real-Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring
               (rtCGM), on glucose control in individuals with type 1 diabetes.
               Methods: Ten physically active individuals with type 1 diabetes
               were invited to participate in a 3-day long sports camp with the
               objective to evaluate CHO-loading and high intermittent
               CHO-intake during prolonged PE. 1.5 months later the same
               procedure was evaluated in relation to a 90 km cross-country
               skiing race (Vasaloppet). Participants were instructed to act
               proactively using rtCGM with predictive alerts to maintain
               sensor glucose values within target range, defined as 72-180
               mg/dl (4-10 mmol/l). Results: Mean glucose values during
               CHO-loading were: day 1; 140.4 $\pm$ 45.0 mg/dl (7.8 $\pm$ 2.5
               mmol/l) and day 2; 120.6 $\pm$ 41.4 mg/dl (6.7 $\pm$ 2.3
               mmol/l). Mean sensor glucose at start of PE was 126.0 $\pm$ 25.2
               mg/dl (7.0 $\pm$ 1.4 mmol/l) and throughout PE 127.8 $\pm$ 25.2
               mg/dl (7.1 $\pm$ 1.4 mmol/l). Percentage of time spent in range
               (TIR) respective time spent in hypoglycemia was: CHO-loading
               74.7/10.4\% and during PE 94.3/0.6\%. Conclusions: High
               intermittent CHO-intake during prolonged PE combined with
               proactive use of rtCGM is associated with good glycemic control
               during prolonged exercise in individuals with diabetes type 1.
               However, the time spent in hypoglycemia during the 2-days of
               CHO-loading was 10.4\% and therefore a lower insulin dose might
               be suggested to reduce the time spent in hypoglycemia. Clinical

               the current study was to examine changes in food intake, insulin
               administration, and 24-h glycemic control in response to
               consecutive days with prolonged walking exercise (8h daily) in
               individuals with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: Ten individuals with
               type 1 diabetes participating in the worlds' largest walking
               event were recruited for this observational study. Simultaneous
               measurements of 24-h glycemic control (continuous glucose
               monitoring), insulin administration and food intake were
               performed during a non-walking day (control) and during three
               subsequent days with prolonged walking exercise (daily distance
               40 or 50km). RESULTS: Despite an increase in daily energy
               (31$\pm$18\%; p10 mmol/L) and hypoglycemia (blood glucose 0.05

               increments in energy and carbohydrate intake. When taking such

               theoretical mechanism using continuous ECG and continuous
               glucose monitoring in a group of patients with type 1 diabetes.
               METHODS: Twenty-five patients with type 1 diabetes (age 20-50
               years) underwent two separate 24 h ECG and continuous glucose
               monitoring periods. Patients were fully ambulant and carried out
               normal daily activities. RESULTS: There were 13 episodes (26\%
               of recordings) of nocturnal hypoglycaemia, eight of <2.2 mmol/l
               and five of 2.2-3.4 mmol/l. Corrected QT interval (QTc) was
               longer during nocturnal hypoglycaemia compared with

               We assessed the effects of controlled hypoglycaemia on cardiac

               T-wave and QRS complex morphology in 16 type 1 diabetic patients
               and eight healthy counterparts. Several electrocardiographic
               variables characterising repolarisation were analysed from
               digitised 12-lead electrocardiograms during a euglycaemic and a
               hypoglycaemic clamp. RESULTS: Hypoglycaemia did not result in
               significant changes either in the QT interval corrected for
               heart rate by the nomogram method or in QT dispersion. However,
               the morphology of the T-wave changed significantly during

               responsible for this finding. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: For
               this study, 22 type 1 diabetic subjects (11 men and 11 women,
               age 27 +/- 2 years, BMI 24 +/- 1 kg/m(2), A1C 7.9 +/- 0.2\%)
               underwent four separate randomized 2-day protocols, with
               overnight normalization of blood glucose. Day 1 consisted of
               morning and afternoon 2-h hyperinsulinemic- (9 pmol x kg(-1) x
               min(-1)) euglycemic clamps (5.1 mmol/l), hypoglycemic clamps
               (2.9 mmol/l), or euglycemic clamps with a physiologic low-dose
               intravenous infusion of cortisol to reproduce levels found
               during hypoglycemia or a high-dose infusion, which resulted in
               further twofold greater elevations of plasma cortisol. Day 2
               consisted of 90-min euglycemic cycling exercise at 50\%
               Vo(2max). RESULTS: During exercise, glucose levels were
               equivalently clamped at 5.1 +/- 0.1 mmol/l and insulin was
               allowed to fall to similar levels. Glucagon, growth hormone,
               epinephrine, norepinephrine, and pancreatic polypeptide
               responses during day 2 exercise were significantly blunted
               following antecedent hypoglycemia, low- and high-dose cortisol,
               compared with antecedent euglycemia. Endogenous glucose
               production and lipolysis were also significantly reduced
               following day 1 low- and high-dose cortisol. CONCLUSIONS:
               Antecedent physiologic increases in cortisol (equivalent to
               levels occurring during hypoglycemia) resulted in blunted
               neuroendocrine, autonomic nervous system, and metabolic

               elevations of cortisol may play a role in the development of

               sleep mostly at night, and they do so at approximately 24-h
               intervals. If they do not adhere to this general pattern, for
               instance when working night shifts or when travelling across

               circadian clock. In recent years much has been discovered about
               the organisation of the circadian clock. New photoreceptor cells
               in the retina have been found to influence the input to the
               clock, and much of the molecular machinery of the clock has been

               3 consecutive days to assess mean sleep duration during normal
               daily life. A subsample of 37 patients also performed 24-h
               ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Medical history,
               sleep questionnaires, and diabetes-related quality of life
               (DQOL) were assessed. RESULTS: Patients having shorter sleep
               duration--less than 6.5 h (n=21)--had higher levels of HbA1c
               (P=0.01) than patients with longer sleep duration, above 6.5 h
               (n=58). In a multivariable regression model including shorter
               versus longer sleep duration, diabetes duration, DQOL score, and
               daily activity, sleep duration was the only variable
               independently associated with HbA1c (R2=10\%). In patients who
               performed 24-h ABPM, patients with a nondipping pattern of blood
               pressure exhibited shorter sleep duration than patients with a
               dipping pattern of blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Shorter sleep
               duration is associated with higher HbA1c levels in patients with
               type 1 diabetes, as well as with a nondipping pattern of blood
               pressure, anticipating a long-term deleterious impact on the
               risk of microvascular complications. Further studies should test
               whether extending the duration of sleep may improve both HbA1c
               and blood pressure in type 1 diabetes.",

               duration and late-night snacking on glycemic control in patients
               with type 1 diabetes using insulin pumps. The aim of the present
               study was to examine whether late-night eating habits and short
               sleep duration are associated with glycemic control in
               continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion-treated type 1 diabetic
               patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 148 consecutive
               adult type 1 diabetic subjects using an insulin pump (100 women
               and 48 men). Participants completed a questionnaire regarding
               sleep duration (classified as short if $\leq$6 h) and late-night
               snacking. Other sources of information included medical records
               and data from blood glucose meters. Glycemic control was
               assessed by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and mean
               self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) readings. RESULTS: The
               mean age of patients was 26 years, mean type 1 diabetes duration
               was 13.4 years and mean HbA1c level was 7.2\%. In a univariate
               regression analysis, sleep duration was a predictor of both
               HbA1c ($\beta$ = 0.51, P = 0.01) and SMBG levels ($\beta$ =
               11.4, P = 0.02). Additionally, an association was found between
               frequent late-night snacking and higher SMBG readings (often
               snacking $\beta$ = 18.1, P = 0.05), but not with increased HbA1c
               levels. In the multivariate linear regression, independent
               predictors for HbA1c and SMBG were sleep duration and patient
               age. In a univariate logistic regression, sleep duration and
               frequency of late-night snacking were not predictors of whether
               HbA1c target levels were achieved. CONCLUSIONS: Short sleep
               duration, but not late-night snacking, seems to be associated
               with poorer glycemic control in type 1 diabetic patients treated
               with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.",

              adaptations of skeletal muscle (i.e. the 'train low, compete
              high' paradigm) is a hot topic within sport nutrition. Train-low
              studies involve periodically training (e.g., 30-50\% of training
              sessions) with reduced CHO availability, where train-low models
              include twice per day training, fasted training, post-exercise
              CHO restriction and 'sleep low, train low'. When compared with
              high CHO availability, data suggest that augmented cell
              signalling (73\% of 11 studies), gene expression (75\% of 12
              studies) and training-induced increases in oxidative enzyme
              activity/protein content (78\% of 9 studies) associated with
              'train low' are especially apparent when training sessions are
              commenced within a specific range of muscle glycogen
              concentrations. Nonetheless, such muscle adaptations do not
              always translate to improved exercise performance (e.g. 37 and
              63\% of 11 studies show improvements or no change, respectively).
              Herein, we present our rationale for the glycogen threshold
              hypothesis, a window of muscle glycogen concentrations that
              simultaneously permits completion of required training workloads

              adaptations. We also present the 'fuel for the work required'
              paradigm (representative of an amalgamation of train-low models)
              whereby CHO availability is adjusted in accordance with the
              demands of the upcoming training session(s). In order to
              strategically implement train-low sessions, our challenge now is
              to quantify the glycogen cost of habitual training sessions (so
              as to inform the attainment of any potential threshold) and
              ensure absolute training intensity is not compromised, while also
              creating a metabolic milieu conducive to facilitating the

               both nuclear and mitochondrial (mt) DNA genomes and is
               regulated, for the most part, by the peroxisome

               Several other exercise-inducible proteins also play important

               substrate to meet the demands of high daily training intensities
               and volumes. However, during the past decade, data from our
               laboratories and others have demonstrated that deliberately
               training in conditions of reduced CHO availability can promote
               training-induced adaptations of human skeletal muscle (i.e.
               increased maximal mitochondrial enzyme activities and/or
               mitochondrial content, increased rates of lipid oxidation and,
               in some instances, improved exercise capacity). Such data have
               led to the concept of 'training low, but competing high' whereby
               selected training sessions are completed in conditions of
               reduced CHO availability (so as to promote training adaptation),
               but CHO reserves are restored immediately prior to an important
               competition. The augmented training response observed with
               training-low strategies is likely regulated by enhanced
               activation of key cell signalling kinases (e.g. AMPK, p38MAPK),
               transcription factors (e.g. p53, PPAR$\delta$) and
               transcriptional co-activators (e.g. PGC-1$\alpha$), such that a
               co-ordinated up-regulation of both the nuclear and mitochondrial
               genomes occurs. Although the optimal practical strategies to
               train low are not currently known, consuming additional
               caffeine, protein, and practising CHO mouth-rinsing before
               and/or during training may help to rescue the reduced training
               intensities that typically occur when 'training low', in
               addition to preventing protein breakdown and maintaining optimal
               immune function. Finally, athletes should practise 'train-low'
               workouts in conjunction with sessions undertaken with normal or
               high CHO availability so that their capacity to oxidise CHO is

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The artificial pancreas is an emerging technology
               for the treatment of type 1 diabetes and two configurations have
               been proposed: single-hormone (insulin alone) and dual-hormone
               (insulin and glucagon). We aimed to delineate the usefulness of
               glucagon in the artificial pancreas system. METHODS: We did a
               randomised crossover trial of dual-hormone artificial pancreas,
               single-hormone artificial pancreas, and conventional insulin
               pump therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion) in
               participants aged 12 years or older with type 1 diabetes.
               Participants were assigned in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio with blocked
               randomisation to the three interventions and attended a research
               facility for three 24-h study visits. During visits when the
               patient used the single-hormone artificial pancreas, insulin was
               delivered based on glucose sensor readings and a predictive
               dosing algorithm. During dual-hormone artificial pancreas
               visits, glucagon was also delivered during low or falling
               glucose. During conventional insulin pump therapy visits,
               patients received continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. The
               study was not masked. The primary outcome was the time for which
               plasma glucose concentrations were in the target range (4.0-10.0
               mmol/L for 2 h postprandially and 4.0-8.0 mmol/L otherwise).
               Hypoglycaemic events were defined as plasma glucose
               concentration of less than 3.3 mmol/L with symptoms or less than
               3.0 mmol/L irrespective of symptoms. Analysis was by modified
               intention to treat, in which we included data for all patients
               who completed at least two visits. A p value of less than 0.0167
               (0.05/3) was regarded as significant. This trial is registered
               with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01754337. FINDINGS: The mean
               proportion of time spent in the plasma glucose target range over
               24 h was 62\% (SD 18), 63\% (18), and 51\% (19) with
               single-hormone artificial pancreas, dual-hormone artificial
               pancreas, and conventional insulin pump therapy, respectively.
               The mean difference in time spent in the target range between
               single-hormone artificial pancreas and conventional insulin pump
               therapy was 11\% (17; p=0.002) and between dual-hormone
               artificial pancreas and conventional insulin pump therapy was
               12\% (21; p=0.00011). There was no difference (15; p=0.75) in
               the proportion of time spent in the target range between the
               single-hormone and dual-hormone artificial pancreas systems.
               There were 52 hypoglycaemic events with conventional insulin
               pump therapy (12 of which were symptomatic), 13 with the
               single-hormone artificial pancreas (five of which were
               symptomatic), and nine with the dual-hormone artificial pancreas
               (0 of which were symptomatic); the number of nocturnal
               hypoglycaemic events was 13 (0 symptomatic), 0, and 0,
               respectively. INTERPRETATION: Single-hormone and dual-hormone
               artificial pancreas systems both provided better glycaemic
               control than did conventional insulin pump therapy. The
               single-hormone artificial pancreas might be sufficient for
               hypoglycaemia-free overnight glycaemic control. FUNDING:

              below 4.0 mmol/l was 11\% (0.0-46.7\%) vs 0\% (0-0\%; p = 0.0001)
              and at glucose levels between 4.0 and 10.0 mmol/l was 71.4\%
              (53.2-100\%) vs 100\% (100-100\%; p = 0.003). Higher doses of
              glucagon were needed during continuous (0.126 $\pm$ 0.057 mg)
              than during interval exercise (0.093 $\pm$ 0.068 mg) (p = 0.03),
              with no reported side-effects in all interventions.
              CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The dual-hormone artificial pancreas
              outperformed the single-hormone artificial pancreas in regulating
              glucose levels during announced exercise in adults with type 1

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Intense exercise is a major challenge to the
              management of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Closed-loop control (CLC)
              systems (artificial pancreas) improve glycemic control during
              limited intensity and short duration of physical activity (PA).
              However, CLC has not been tested during extended vigorous outdoor
              exercise common among adolescents. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:
              Skiing presents unique metabolic challenges: intense prolonged
              PA, cold, altitude, and stress/fear/excitement. In a randomized
              controlled trial, 32 adolescents with T1D (ages 10-16 years)
              participated in a 5-day ski camp (5 h skiing/day) at two sites:
              Wintergreen, VA, and Breckenridge, CO. Participants were
              randomized to the University of Virginia CLC system or remotely
              monitored sensor-augmented pump (RM-SAP). The CLC and RM-SAP
              groups were coarsely paired by age and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).
              All subjects were remotely monitored 24 h per day by the study
              physicians and clinical team. RESULTS: Compared with
              physician-monitored open loop, percent time in range (70-180
              mg/dL) improved using CLC: 71.3 vs. 64.7\% (+6.6\% [95\% CI
              1-12]; P = 0.005), with maximum effect late at night.
              Hypoglycemia exposure and carbohydrate treatments were improved
              overall (P = 0.001 and P = 0.007) and during the daytime with
              strong ski level effects (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.006);
              ski/snowboard proficiency was balanced between groups but with a
              very strong site effect: naive in Virginia and experienced in
              Colorado. There was no adverse event associated with CLC; the
              participants' feedback was overwhelmingly positive. CONCLUSIONS:
              CLC in adolescents with T1D improved glycemic control and reduced
              exposure to hypoglycemia during prolonged intensive winter sport
              activities, despite the added challenges of cold and altitude.",

               activity, and stress challenged glycemic control. METHODS: In a
               randomized controlled trial, 24 adolescents (ages 13-18 years)
               and 24 school-aged children (6-12 years) with Type 1 diabetes

               at three sites: Wintergreen, VA; Kirkwood, and Breckenridge, CO.
               Study participants were randomized 1:1 at each site. The control
               group used remote monitored sensor-augmented pump (RM-SAP), and

               .01 in both children and adolescents. The AP system was
               associated with a significantly lower average glucose based on
               continuous glucose monitor data: 161 $\pm$ 29.9 vs 176.8 $\pm$
               36.5 mg/dL; P = .023. There were no differences between groups
               for hypoglycemia exposure or carbohydrate interventions. There

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: People with type 1 diabetes who use continuous
               subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII, or insulin pump therapy)
               often remove their pump before extended periods of exercise, but
               this approach might result in reduced glycaemic control and
               increased risk of hyperglycaemia and ketogenesis. We aimed to
               assess the efficacy and safety of a hybrid approach, in which
               basal insulin delivery was divided between CSII and a daily
               injection of insulin degludec. METHODS: In this single-centre,
               open-label, proof-of-concept, randomised crossover trial done at
               the LMC Diabetes \& Endocrinology research centre, we recruited
               physically active and aerobically fit participants aged 18 years
               or older with type 1 diabetes who were using CSII. Participants
               were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of a computer-generated
               sequence to one of two sequences of either usual CSII, involving
               the continuation of the participant's usual CSII regimen,
               followed by crossover to hybrid CSII, in which the delivery of
               the participant's usual daily basal insulin dose was split (50\%
               delivered by CSII and 50\% delivered by a once-daily morning
               injection of 100 U/mL insulin degludec), or the opposite
               sequence (ie, hybrid CSII followed by crossover to usual CSII).
               Treatment was not masked to the investigators or participants.
               For each intervention, participants completed a
               moderate-intensity and a high-intensity in-clinic exercise
               session in the first week, followed by four high-intensity and
               two moderate-intensity home-based exercise sessions in the
               subsequent 3 weeks. Insulin pumps were suspended or disconnected
               60 min before exercise and reconnected immediately after
               exercise during both treatment regimens. The coprimary outcomes
               were: (1) time spent in the target control range of 4.0-10.0
               mmol/L blood glucose after high-intensity exercise, and (2) time
               spent in target control range of 4.0-10.0 mmol/L blood glucose
               after moderate-intensity exercise, measured by continuous
               glucose monitoring in the 6-h period from the start of the
               high-intensity and moderate-intensity in-clinic exercise
               sessions. Outcomes were assessed in a modified
               intention-to-treat population that included all participants who
               started both intervention phases and completed all of the
               in-clinic exercise visits. This trial is registered with
               ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03838783, and is complete. FINDINGS:
               Between May 15, 2018, and March 5, 2019, we assessed 43 patients
               for eligibility, of whom 31 were randomly assigned to receive
               the usual CSII regimen (n=14) or hybrid CSII regimen (n=17) in
               the first phase (before crossover). The analysis population
               consisted of 24 participants who completed both study phases.
               Compared with the usual CSII regimen, participants on the hybrid
               CSII regimen had a significantly longer time in blood glucose
               range of 4-10 mmol/L during the 6-h period from the start of
               both moderate-intensity (mean difference 86 min [95\% CI
               61-147], p=0.005; percentage time in range 64\% [SD 35] vs 40\%
               [35]) and high-intensity in-clinic exercise session (60 min
               [11-109], p=0.01; 66\% [32] vs 50\% [27]). Participants on the
               hybrid CSII regimen also showed a higher time in blood glucose
               range of 4-10 mmol/L during home-based exercise sessions (mean
               difference 23 min [95\% CI -1 to 46], p=0.055), with
               significantly lower time spent in hyperglycaemia than
               participants on the usual CSII regimen (mean difference 25 min
               [2-48], p=0.04). These exploratory outcomes also showed no
               significant difference in the amount of time spent in
               hypoglycaemia, nor the number of hypoglycaemic events, between
               the two interventions. There were three study-related adverse
               events reported with the usual CSII regimen (two hypotension
               events and one nausea event) and four with the hybrid CSII
               regimen (two hypotension events and two nausea events).
               INTERPRETATION: A hybrid regimen of injected insulin degludec
               and CSII (with pump removal during exercise) appears to be safe
               and effective in adults with type 1 diabetes who exercise
               regularly. This approach could offer improved glycaemic control
               immediately after exercise and should be further assessed in a
               larger-scale randomised trial. FUNDING: Novo Nordisk.",

abstract = {Abstract People living with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are recommended to undertake regular exercise to maintain health and wellbeing. However, the effects of exercise on glucose concentration are complex, and despite advances in supportive technologies and insulins, exercise remains a challenge for people living with T1D. Despite the challenges, Team Novo Nordisk (TNN) has demonstrated that with planning and determination, people with T1D can successfully pursue endurance sports. TNN has developed, refined, and adapted evidence-based scientific strategies for managing nutrition and glycaemia in elite-level athletes with T1D participating in ultra-endurance events. Advances in technologies, such as continuous glucose monitoring, have facilitated non-invasive and comprehensive observation of the TNN riders, who are supported by a multidisciplinary team of doctors, coaches, researchers, and nutritionists to formulate individualised data-driven strategies. This article highlights the current learnings and data-informed strategies being employed to assist management of diabetes in a professional endurance sport environment, almost 10 years after the publication of ‘Lessons from the professionals: diabetes and pro cycling’ (2013). In recent years, TNN has placed a high level of emphasis on research to improve safety and athletic performance while also striving to make these insights widely available to benefit the broader community.

               normal and juvenile-onset diabetic subjects for 5--6 h in doses
               designed to simulate the increments observed in insulin
               hypoglycemia or severe stress. Plasma glucose and glucose
               kinetics were normalized in the diabetics before each experiment
               by infusion of insulin (0.25--1.0 U/h) for 4--6 h, which was
               then continued during anti-insulin hormone administration.
               Infusion of cortisol and epinephrine produced comparable
               elevations in plasma cortisol (35--45 /$\mu$g/dl) and plasma
               epinephrine (350--450 pg/ml) in normal and diabetic subjects.
               However, the increment in plasma glucose in diabetics after
               cortisol (86 $\pm$ 15 mg/dl) and epinephrine (129 $\pm$ 12
               mg/dl) infusion was fivefold to sevenfold greater than it was in
               normals (P < 0.001), despite ongoing insulin infusion. Whereas
               cortisol failed to alter glucose production in normals, in
               diabetics there was a progressive 35\% increase in glucose
               production (P < 0.001). Similarly, epinephrine produced only a
               transient (<90 min) 60\% rise in glucose production in normal
               subjects, but caused a sustained 50\%--90\% rise in glucose
               production in diabetics throughout the entire 5-h study. In
               contrast, both cortisol and epinephrine infusion was accompanied
               by a 25\%--40\% (P < 0.001) decline in glucose clearance, no
               different than in normal and diabetic subjects. Glucagon
               infusion produced a transient 35\%--40\% rise in glucose
               production, which was of comparable magnitude and duration in
               normal controls and diabetics. However, the glucagon-induced
               rise in plasma glucose was threefold greater in the diabetics
               due to failure of endogenous insulin secretion and consequent
               lack of an increase in glucose clearance as observed in normal
               controls. When saline was administered to the insulin-infused
               diabetics, neither plasma glucose nor glucose production were
               altered from baseline values. It is concluded that (1) the
               hyperglycemic effect of each of the anti-insulin hormones is
               increased in diabetics, in spite of prior normalization of
               plasma glucose concentration, by continuous insulin infusion and
               (2) hyperglycemia is particularly exaggerated by elevations of
               cortisol and epinephrine in diabetes as a consequence of an
               altered response of the liver to these hormones.",

              people living with type 1 diabetes are pushing their physical
              limits to compete at the highest level of sport. However, the
              post-exercise recovery routine, particularly with a focus on
              sporting performance, has received little attention within the
              scientific literature, with most of the focus being placed on
              insulin or nutritional adaptations to manage glycaemia before and
              during the exercise bout. The post-exercise recovery period
              presents an opportunity for maximising training adaption and
              recovery, and the clinical management of glycaemia through the
              rest of the day and overnight. The absence of clear guidance for
              the post-exercise period means that people with type 1 diabetes
              should either develop their own recovery strategies on the basis
              of individual trial and error, or adhere to guidelines that have
              been developed for people without diabetes. This Review provides
              an up-to-date consensus on post-exercise recovery and glucose
              management for individuals living with type 1 diabetes. We aim
              to: (1) outline the principles and time course of post-exercise
              recovery, highlighting the implications and challenges for
              endurance athletes living with type 1 diabetes; (2) provide an
              overview of potential strategies for post-exercise recovery that
              could be used by athletes with type 1 diabetes to optimise
              recovery and adaptation, alongside improved glycaemic monitoring
              and management; and (3) highlight the potential for technology to
              ease the burden of managing glycaemia in the post-exercise
              recovery period.",

               individuals living in Europe were aggregated and retrospectively
               analysed. The mean glucose management indicator (GMI),

               glycaemia pre-Auto Mode initiation was also performed. RESULTS:
               Users (N = 14 899) spent a mean of 81.4\% of the time in Auto
               Mode and achieved a mean GMI of 7.0\% $\pm$ 0.4\%, TIR of 72.0\%

               was observed in the latter, an increase primarily due to
               increased basal insulin delivery. By contrast, basal insulin

               technology, an advanced hybrid closed-loop system, became

               comprehensively reported. Methods: Individuals with type 1
               diabetes (T1D) ($\geq$14 years of age) who had $\geq$21 days of
               pump usage data were invited via email to participate.
               Participants completed psychosocial questionnaires (Technology
               Acceptance Scale [TAS], well-being index [WHO-5], and Diabetes
               Impact and Devices Satisfaction [DIDS] scale) at timepoint 1

              closed-loop algorithm) afternoon physical activity and during the
              following night in young people with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: A
              randomised, two-arm, open-label, in-hospital, crossover clinical
              trial was performed at a single site in Slovenia. The order was
              randomly determined using an automated web-based programme with
              randomly permuted blocks of four. Allocation assignment was not
              masked. Children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes who were
              experienced insulin pump users were eligible for the trial.
              During four separate in-hospital visits, the participants
              performed two unannounced exercise protocols: moderate intensity
              (55\% of [Formula: see text]) and moderate intensity with
              integrated high-intensity sprints (55/80\% of [Formula: see
              text]), using the same study device either for closed-loop or
              open-loop insulin delivery. We investigated glycaemic control
              during the exercise period and the following night. The
              closed-loop insulin delivery was applied from 15:00 h on the day
              of the exercise to 13:00 h on the following day. RESULTS: Between
              20 January and 16 June 2016, 20 eligible participants (9 female,
              mean age 14.2 $\pm$ 2.0 years, HbA1c 7.7 $\pm$ 0.6\% [60.0 $\pm$
              6.6 mmol/mol]) were included in the trial and performed all
              trial-mandated activities. The median proportion of time spent in
              hypoglycaemia below 3.3 mmol/l was 0.00\% for both treatment
              modalities (p = 0.7910). Use of the closed-loop insulin delivery
              system increased the proportion of time spent within the target
              glucose range of 3.9-10 mmol/l when compared with open-loop
              delivery: 84.1\% (interquartile range 70.0-85.5) vs 68.7\%
              (59.0-77.7), respectively (p = 0.0057), over the entire study
              period. This was achieved with significantly less insulin
              delivered via the closed-loop (p = 0.0123).
              CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Closed-loop insulin delivery was safe
              both during and after unannounced exercise protocols in the
              in-hospital environment, maintaining glucose values mostly within
              the target range without an increased risk of hypoglycaemia.

               at mealtime in preparation for exercise taken 90 min after

               the closed-loop system (increases target glucose levels) in
               addition to a 33\% reduction in meal bolus (A-RB); (2) announced
               exercise to the closed-loop system and a full meal bolus (A-FB);
               (3) unannounced exercise and a full meal bolus (U-FB).
               Participants performed 60 min of exercise at 60\% [Formula: see
               text] 90 min after eating breakfast. The investigators were not
               blinded to the interventions. However, the participants were
               blinded to the sensor glucose readings and to the insulin
               infusion rates throughout the intervention visits. RESULTS: The
               trial was completed by 37 adults with type 1 diabetes, all using
               insulin pumps: mean$\pm$SD, 40.0 $\pm$ 15.0 years of age, HbA1c
               57.1 $\pm$ 10.8 mmol/mol (7.3 $\pm$ 1.0\%). Reported results
               were based on plasma glucose values. During exercise and the
               following 1 h recovery period, time spent in hypoglycaemia (10
               mmol/l) by 21\% (p = 0.001). No side effects were reported
               during the applied strategies. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION:
               Combining postprandial exercise announcement, which increases
               closed-loop system glucose target levels, with a 33\% meal bolus
               reduction significantly reduced time spent in hypoglycaemia
               compared with the other two strategies, yet at the expense of
